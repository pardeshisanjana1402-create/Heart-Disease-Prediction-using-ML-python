    "# Heart Disease Prediction — Project Summary & Dataset Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1) Project Summary (2–3 lines)\n",
    "Heart Disease Prediction is a project focused on identifying individuals at risk of cardiovascular diseases using clinical data. The dataset contains important medical features related to heart health. Machine Learning techniques are used to detect heart disease early, which helps in timely treatment and can save lives.\n",
